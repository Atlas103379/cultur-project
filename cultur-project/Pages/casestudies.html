            <h2>The Evolution of Traditional Lantern Festivals</h2>
            <img src="../images/henry-co-3JFVNo4ukKQ-unsplash.jpg?v=1" alt="Lantern Festival">
            <p>
                <strong>Lantern festivals</strong> have been celebrated for centuries, originating in <strong>China during the Han Dynasty</strong>. Initially, 
                they were a way to honor ancestors and deities, but over time, they became vibrant social and cultural events.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Traditional lanterns were handcrafted using paper, bamboo, and candles. In contrast, modern lanterns use <strong>LED lights and biodegradable materials</strong>, 
                making them more eco-friendly and visually spectacular. While the essence of these festivals remains the same, many argue that commercialization has altered 
                their true cultural significance.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Key Challenges:</strong> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Balancing **tradition with modern innovations** like LED-powered drone displays.</li>
                    <li>Preventing **over-commercialization**, which can overshadow cultural heritage.</li>
                    <li>Maintaining **environmental sustainability** while preserving traditional crafts.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The future of lantern festivals depends on how well they can integrate modern technology while preserving their historical and spiritual meaning.

            <h2>Preserving Ancient Ruins: A Case for Sustainable Tourism</h2>
            <img src="../images/jack-ward-rknrvCrfS1k-unsplash.jpg?v=1" alt="Ancient Ruins">
            <p>
                <strong>Ancient ruins</strong> serve as a bridge to the past, offering insights into the lives of civilizations long gone. However, they are under constant threat 
                from <strong>tourism, climate change, and pollution</strong>. Sites like Machu Picchu, the Parthenon, and Petra face damage due to millions of visitors each year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Countries have begun implementing **sustainable tourism policies** to counteract this damage. Peru, for instance, now **limits the number of visitors** to 
                Machu Picchu, while Italy has **banned large cruise ships** from docking near Venice to protect its historic structures.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Solutions for Sustainable Tourism:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using **3D scanning technology** to digitally preserve ruins.</li>
                    <li>Creating **virtual tourism experiences** to reduce foot traffic.</li>
                    <li>Implementing **strict visitor guidelines** to minimize physical wear.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The challenge is to find a balance where <strong>tourism benefits local economies</strong> without compromising **the structural integrity of these historical sites**.

            <h2>How Modern Architecture is Shaping the Future</h2>
            <img src="../images/pexels-bestbe-models-975242-2170387.jpg?v=1" alt="Modern Cityscape">
            <p>
                <strong>Architecture</strong> is evolving at an unprecedented rate, blending **technology, sustainability, and cultural identity**. 
                Modern cities are shifting towards **smart, eco-friendly urban environments**, focusing on efficiency and climate resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
                A great example is **Singapore**, which integrates **vertical gardens, rooftop farms, and energy-efficient buildings** to create a sustainable metropolis. 
                Other cities, such as **Dubai and Tokyo**, are pushing the boundaries with **AI-powered infrastructure** and **self-sufficient skyscrapers**.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Major Trends in Modern Architecture:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Green buildings** that generate their own energy and recycle waste.</li>
                    <li>**Smart cities** using AI to optimize traffic, lighting, and resources.</li>
                    <li>**Adaptive architecture** that withstands extreme weather conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                However, rapid urbanization has its downsides. **High-rise developments often displace local communities**, leading to economic disparities.  
                The challenge is to ensure **inclusive urban growth**, where innovation benefits everyone, not just the wealthy elite.
